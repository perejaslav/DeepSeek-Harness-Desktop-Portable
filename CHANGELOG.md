# Changelog

All notable changes to DeepSeek Harness Desktop are documented here.
Versioning follows the `package.json` version; GitHub Actions builds and
publishes a Release (NSIS + portable + `latest.yml`) on every `v*` tag.

## [0.6.3] — 2026-09-11

Bundled DeepSeek Harness runtime: **`0.1.0-rc.6` → `0.1.5-rc.2`**.

### Changed

- **Updated the bundled DSH runtime to `0.1.5-rc.2`.** Every `@deepseek-ai/dsh*` and `@deepseek-ai/cordis*` pin moved together — mixing versions in the family breaks the loader at boot. `@deepseek-ai/cordis` resolves to `4.0.2`, and `@deepseek-ai/cordis-plugin-group` to `1.0.2` (the newest companion compatible with that cordis). The Electron shell is unchanged.
- **Vendored `dsh-better-sidebar` peer ranges repinned to `^0.1.5-rc.2`.** The old `^0.1.0-rc.6` ranges do not resolve to `0.1.5-rc.2`: a prerelease range only matches the same `major.minor.patch` tuple.

### Added

- **DSH compatibility layer** for the 0.1.5-rc.2 API changes (full detail in [`docs/DSH_RUNTIME.md`](docs/DSH_RUNTIME.md)):
  - `healProfilesModuleFallback` became async and takes a single options object.
  - Index rendering moved from raw `tapIndex` transforms to a structured `webserver/index-inject` row table, so the in-process webServer stub now implements `collectIndexInjections()` / `renderIndex()`. Without this the main process still reached `ready` while the renderer died with `window.__ModuleLoader__ bootstrap facade is missing` — a blank window.
  - Client bundles are advertised as a combined `/plugins/??a/client.js,b/client.js&rev=…` request, which must stay absolute under `app://` so the `/plugins` prefix route can serve it.
  - `@deepseek-ai/dsh-settings` no longer exports `settingsNamespace`; the vendored sidebar passes its already-validated namespace through directly.
- **Automated upstream version checks** (`scripts/check-dsh-update.mjs` + `.github/workflows/check-dsh-update.yml`): a daily semver comparison across the `latest` and `next` channels (with opt-in `alpha`), followed by a coordinated bump, the test suite, a boot smoke test, and a review PR. Auto-merge is deliberately off.
- **`scripts/bump-dsh-version.mjs`** — the only supported way to move the runtime. It updates every DSH pin, the cordis companions, the vendored plugins' peer ranges and `dsh-runtime.json`, then refreshes the lockfile with `npm install --package-lock-only`.
- **`dsh-runtime.json`** — the runtime manifest that CI, the docs and the update check read.
- **Windows compatibility CI**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (fast-ci + windows-integration) and `windows-build.yml` (installers as artifacts). The release workflow is now gated — `npm run dist` runs only after the tests and a real boot succeed, and the packaged runtime version is verified against the manifest before publishing.
- **Compatibility tests** (`tests/compat.test.mjs`) and a hermetic boot smoke test (`scripts/smoke-boot.mjs`, `npm run smoke`). The smoke test asserts the app reaches `ready` on the pinned runtime with **no renderer errors**, against a throwaway DSH home, so `~/.dsh` is never read or written.
- **Safe DSH update/rollback path**: the bundled runtime remains a permanent fallback, and a user-level runtime overlay can be rolled back from the app.

### Removed

- **The `dsh-tool-bash-persistent` patch is upstream now** — retired per the patch audit (KEEP / ADAPT / REMOVE / UPSTREAM FIXED), replaced by an assertion that reports loudly if the upstream fix regresses.

## [0.6.2] — 2026-08-19

### Changed

- **Merged the official upstream persistent-bash fix**: `dsh-tool-bash-persistent` used to override PS1 to a private prompt while `dsh-terminal-bash` waits for its own `dsh> ` prompt — the mismatch disabled prompt-based readiness, so every command fell back to the 3.5s idle-silence settle. Official master keeps the backend's own prompt (`stty -echo` only); this is now applied to our bundled copy via `scripts/apply-official-patches.mjs` (idempotent, runs on `postinstall`/`predist`), so simple commands settle in milliseconds instead of 3.5 seconds. The fix survives fresh `npm ci` and carries into the packaged build.
- **Boot self-healing for profile bundles**: if the profile manifest lists a bundle its node_modules cannot compose (interrupted pnpm run, non-bundle listed as a bundle), the boot now runs a `pnpm install` heal and drops still-broken ids from `dsh.profile.bundles` (dependencies kept) instead of failing loud — a broken plugin degrades to a log line rather than taking down the app.

## [0.6.1] — 2026-08-15

### Fixed

- **Sidebar tab bar hidden under the desktop chrome**: the built-in sidebar's "position compat mode" (`titleBarCompat`) is now **on by default** — the sidebar toggle buttons and the tab bar (Explorer / Git / Terminal / Subagent / Browser) are pushed down clear of the app's 36px glass title bar, so new tabs are reachable out of the box. The strip height stays tunable (Settings → Side card → gear, 0–120px). Only affects profiles that have not persisted the pref; existing saved values win.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-08-15

### Added

- **Built-in sidebar workbench (vendored [dsh-better-sidebar](https://github.com/omdsh-dev/DSH-better-sidebar) v0.12.2)**: a VSCode-like right sidebar + bottom panel per conversation — file explorer, CodeMirror editor with image/Markdown/HTML/PDF preview, real PowerShell terminal, Git panel (diff/history/stage/commit), sandboxed embedded browser, subagent topology and background jobs. Shipped as a desktop bundle (`plugins/dsh-better-sidebar/`), auto-installed into the profile on first boot like the other desktop bundles; no user setup.
- **Generic WebSocket-over-IPC bridge for the desktop carrier** (`src/ws-ipc.mjs` + `ipc-bridge.mjs` + `preload.cjs`): any loopback WebSocket now rides a full-duplex IPC channel (RFC 6455 frame codec + mock duplex for the in-process `ws` servers), with a ready-ack so early frames (transcript replays) are never lost. Plugin upgrade routes such as `/sidebar/ws/terminal` work unchanged.
- **`app://` protocol dispatches webServer routes first** (`main.mjs`): `<img>`/`<iframe>`/lazy-chunk `<script>`/download requests to `/sidebar/*` are served in-process instead of 404'ing against the static site.
- **First-boot vendored-deps bootstrap** (`boot.mjs` `ensureVendorDeps`): the plugin's runtime deps (ws / schemastery / node-pty) install into the plugin directory via the bundled pnpm (node_modules stays out of the repo).

### Changed

- The better-sidebar fork defers node-pty loading (`src/pty-manager.ts` / `src/agent-pty.ts`) so a platform without a usable pty binary degrades to a clear terminal error instead of taking down the plugin; the NAPI prebuilt (node-pty ≥ 1.1) loads under Electron as-is.

### Fixed

- Terminal connection bugs surfaced during desktop bring-up: the WebSocket shim now supports classic `socket.onopen/onmessage/...` property handlers, and the bridge buffers pre-ready frames (reconnect transcript replay) — both previously left the terminal stuck on "connecting".

## [0.5.6] — 2026-08-14

### Added

- **External-plugin install compatibility**: community plugins that install bundles by re-invoking the app (`execPath <argv> plugin --profile web add|remove <spec>`, as the plugin store's own install button does) now work. The app detects the CLI invocation and runs add/remove through the bundled pnpm runner (no console window), delegating any other `plugin` subcommand to the bundled dsh CLI, then exits without booting the UI.

## [0.5.5] — 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- **Plugin store "载入目录失败"**: the desktop fetch shim routed every renderer `fetch` through the in-process carrier, which only serves `app://localhost` — external URLs (the store catalog at `dsh.aitreez.com`, CDNs) were rejected. External fetches now use the real browser fetch; only `app://localhost` traffic crosses the IPC bridge.

## [0.5.4] — 2026-08-14

### Changed

- **Marketplace replaced by the community plugin store**: the bundled marketplace plugin is retired (no longer shipped or auto-installed). The `dsh-plugin-store` bundle (ZASENJC) now provides the in-app store — install it with `dsh plugin add github:ZASENJC/dsh-plugins-store#path:packages/dsh-plugin-store`, then access it via 设置 → 插件 → 插件商店, the `/store` command, or the session toolbar. Profiles that still have `@dsh-desktop/marketplace` registered are pruned on boot.

## [0.5.3] — 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- **No black console window during install/uninstall**: the runner previously went through the dsh CLI, whose internal `spawnSync("pnpm", {shell:true})` opened a visible `cmd.exe` window. pnpm is now spawned directly (real arguments, hidden window), and the profile manifest's `dsh.profile.bundles` reconciliation runs in-process — the same contract the dsh CLI applies, minus the console and the shell-quoting fragility.

## [0.5.2] — 2026-08-14

### Added

- **Install progress, cancel, and timeout** (referencing the community `dsh-webui-market-plugin`): a marketplace install now streams the live `dsh plugin add` (pnpm) output in a progress panel, can be cancelled mid-flight (the host kills the task), and aborts after 10 minutes instead of hanging silently on a slow network.
- **Uninstall**: installed plugins can be removed (`dsh plugin remove`) from the detail view and the installed list, and the list refreshes immediately.

## [0.5.1] — 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- **Desktop plugins (marketplace / file-changes / balance) missing after 0.5.0**: the `dsh plugin add` bundle install silently failed in the packaged app. Three root causes in the runner: (a) pnpm's `exports` map hides `./package.json`, so the CLI-path resolution threw; (b) install paths containing spaces (e.g. `…\DeepSeek Harness Desktop\…`) were split by the shell when `dsh plugin` forwarded specs to pnpm; (c) the child-process paths still pointed inside `app.asar` instead of the asar-unpacked real files. All three are fixed — the shipped bundles now install and register on the next boot.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-08-14

### Changed

- **"Everything is a plugin" refactor**:
  - The desktop overlay is now a declarative `src/desktop.patch.yml` patch layer (the same format as a profile/bundle `cordis.patch.yml`), parsed at boot; only carrier-level rows (webserver/web-runtime/client-hmr/directory-picker) remain there.
  - The three desktop plugins (balance / file-changes / marketplace) are now proper dsh bundles — each declares `dsh.bundle` plus a `cordis.patch.yml` — installed into the `web` profile through the official `dsh plugin add <path>` (pnpm link + bundle registration) instead of a manual file copy and hardcoded rows. Their rows compose via `dsh.profile.bundles`.
- **Marketplace install risk confirmation**: installing now requires explicit confirmation (third-party code runs inside the DSH process; a restart applies the bundle), matching the official plugin store's gate.

## [0.4.8] — 2026-08-14

### Added

- **Monorepo plugin install**: when a repo's root is not a bundle but a workspace subdirectory (e.g. `packages/*`) declares `dsh.bundle`, the marketplace now installs it with `dsh plugin add github:<owner>/<repo>#path:<subdir>` instead of giving up.

## [0.4.7] — 2026-08-14

### Changed

- **Marketplace installs via the official `dsh plugin add` mechanism** instead of a bare `npm install`: real npm bundles install with `dsh plugin add <name>` and unpublished bundles with `dsh plugin add github:<repo>` (pnpm is now bundled, so the packaged app has no external pnpm/corepack requirement). Installs land in the `web` profile and take effect after restart.
- **Each repo's real install method is detected and shown**: the detail view now distinguishes npm / git bundle / one-line installer script (with copy button) / agent skill / MCP service / application / manual, instead of assuming everything is an npm package.

## [0.4.6] — 2026-08-14

### Added

- **Update progress is now visible end to end**: downloading shows a progress pill and a live 2px bar in the window chrome (plus a taskbar progress indicator); when the download finishes the pill switches to "更新已就绪，退出时安装"; transient states (checking / up to date / failure) appear briefly and auto-hide.
- **Visible installer during the install phase**: quitting with a downloaded update now hands over to the installer with its own progress UI instead of a silent `/S` run, and the app relaunches when it finishes.

## [0.4.5] — 2026-08-14

### Changed

- **"检查更新" now always answers visibly**: the menu entry previously ran the check silently — when it found a new version there was nothing on screen until the download finished, so it felt dead. It now shows a dialog for every outcome (check failed with the reason / already up to date / new version found and downloading in the background).
- **Automatic update check on startup**: the app checks once, 25 seconds after boot, so users get the "更新已就绪" notification without opening the menu. Concurrent checks are deduplicated.

## [0.4.4] — 2026-08-14

### Added

- **In-app repository details**: every GitHub entry in the marketplace now has a "详情" action that opens a detail view inside the panel — full description, npm publish status (package name / version count / latest / last update, or the precise reason it cannot be installed), a cleaned plain-text README, one-click install, and open-repo links. No need to leave the app to judge a plugin.

### Fixed

- **Unstable `raw.githubusercontent.com` fallback**: repo file fetches (package.json + README) now retry via the GitHub contents API when raw is unreachable — the common CN-network case that previously surfaced as "解析失败（网络不可达）" for everything.

## [0.4.3] — 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- **Marketplace repo links now open in the browser**: the desktop shell denies new-window requests (`setWindowOpenHandler` deny), so the repo-name links and "打开仓库页" buttons were silently dead. They now route through the `openExternal` bridge (same path as the chrome-bar links) and open the GitHub page in the default browser.

## [0.4.2] — 2026-08-14

### Changed

- **Marketplace install guards against unpublished/placeholder packages**: after resolving a GitHub repo's npm package name, the host now verifies the name against the npm registry and refuses install when there is nothing real to install. Resolve failures are distinguished (invalid / network / not-npm / private / unpublished) and the UI shows the matching reason instead of a blanket "not an npm package".
- **Application entries open the repo page instead of installing**: repos classified as `application` (or tagged `desktop-app`) render a "打开仓库页" action rather than a doomed one-click npm install.

## [0.4.1] — 2026-08-14

### Changed

- **Marketplace now lives inside the built-in 设置 panel**: it registers as a real `settings.section` page, so it shares the exact settings chrome (left nav rail, content column, close/Escape/mask). The sidebar entry is styled like the 设置 trigger row. The old overlay remains only as an automatic fallback when the settings shell route is unavailable.
- **File-changes button moved next to the view tabs**: it now sits in the 对话/轨迹 tab row instead of the far-right header corner.

### Fixed

- **White "paper" desktop/taskbar icons**: the 296-character app description overflowed NSIS's shortcut writer and corrupted the `.lnk` icon-location string, so Windows fell back to the generic white icon. The description is shortened, and a custom NSIS `customInstall` step rewrites both shortcuts with valid icon data on every install and update (heals already-affected installs on upgrade).

## [0.4.0] — 2026-08-14

### Added

- **Catalog-first plugin marketplace**: a GitHub Action collects the `dsh-plugin` / `deepseek-harness` / `dsh` topic repos, classifies them into 插件/技能/应用/基础设施/渠道/合集/目录 and scores them (stars × recency); the app fetches `catalog/catalog.json` from the repo with a 24h disk cache — instant search, no GitHub rate limits, offline-capable. The panel gains category chips with counts, 推荐/stars/updated sorting, type badges, topics and update times on cards.
- GitHub-repo install now resolves the npm package name from the repo's `package.json` before installing.

### Fixed

- **RPC channel prefix mismatch**: plugin handlers registered as `ui.on('marketplace-search')` while the renderer called `dsh:marketplace-search` — search/install/restore RPCs never reached the host (marketplace and file-changes alike). Channels are now consistently `dsh:`-prefixed.

## [0.3.2] — 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- **Marketplace and file-changes panels were click-through**: the `shell.overlay` layer is pointer-transparent by design and entries must opt back in with `pointer-events: auto`; without it the panels rendered but every control inside them was dead ("no reaction" to clicks).
- Marketplace now has a second entry point (⋯ menu → 插件市场, dispatched as a window event) and surfaces search failures (e.g. GitHub rate limits) instead of silently showing an empty list.

## [0.3.1] — 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- **Installed builds crashed at startup** (`ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND: @deepseek-ai/cordis-plugin-group` from `dsh-app-boot`): electron-builder's node-modules collector pruned the 19 packages npm auto-installed to satisfy peerDependencies. They are now pinned as explicit root dependencies; the packaged tree matches dev 195/195.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-08-14

### Added

- **Plugin marketplace** (`plugins/desktop-marketplace`): search the GitHub `dsh-plugin` topic and the npm registry from the sidebar; install with the bundled `npm` (no Node.js required on the target machine) and mount at runtime via `ctx.loader.create` — no restart for the host half, one UI reload for new client bundles.
- **Dual-channel updates**: besides the existing shell auto-update, the ⋯ menu can now install a newer official `@deepseek-ai/dsh` into `<userData>/agent` (staging → atomic swap) and boot the whole composition from it — healed fallback junctions are re-pointed in-process; one-click rollback to the bundled copy.
- Self-contained npm runner (`src/npm-runner.mjs`): bundled `npm@10` executed under Electron's own Node (`ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1` on the child env only).

### Fixed

- npm@12 is unsupported on Electron's Node 22.21 → pinned `npm@10`.
- `npm/bin/npm-cli.js` is hidden by npm's exports map → resolve via `npm/package.json`.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-08-14

### Added

- **File changes + one-click restore** (`plugins/desktop-file-changes`): a session-header "文件" button lists every write/edit the agent made (live event stream, +/− line stats via LCS) and restores them per-op or all at once. Reverts run behind a hard fence: absolute paths under session-cwd/workspace roots only, dangerous extensions refused, snippet swaps verify current content; writes restore a previously viewed content or delete only byte-identical files.
- `desktopUi.on` — sender-verified renderer RPC channels for desktop plugins.

### Fixed

- `ctx.slots.register` call shape (the component must be the second argument of `register`, not a third argument of `inject`) — previously caused React error #130 on `shell.overlay` entries.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-08-14

### Added

- **Frameless glass chrome**: custom 36px title bar (drag region, whale icon, version badge, ⋯ menu with app/dsh update + rollback + about + quit, min/max/close), Win11 rounded corners, startup splash. Themed by the DSH UI's CSS variables.
- **Balance widget** (`plugins/desktop-balance`): `余额 ¥X · 本轮 ¥Y` in the composer dock; balance polled from `/user/balance`, per-turn cost folded from live provider usage; click → top-up page.
- Desktop plugin infrastructure: `plugins/*` packages copied into the profile's node_modules and mounted through the desktop overlay; `desktopUi` service (send + on) injected into the host tree.
- GitHub Actions release automation: `v*` tag → build on `windows-latest` → Release with installers, blockmap and `latest.yml`; `publish.url` points at `/releases/latest/download` so installed builds self-update without a separate server. Space-free artifact names for updater-safe URLs.

### Changed

- App/tray/installer icon switched to the official black whale (DeepSeek Harness favicon) via `scripts/rasterize.mjs`.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-08-13

Initial release.

- In-process host composition (no child process, no port, no HTTP server) with the IPC transport (`dsh:fetch`/`dsh:ws-*`) replacing fetch/WebSocket in the renderer.
- `app://localhost` privileged scheme; dist materialized beside user data with the official boot-manifest pipeline.
- Tray residency, host-event native notifications, first-run home wizard with `dsh web` conflict guard, renderer crash recovery, chunked IPC responses, session export with taskbar progress, `electron-updater` wiring.
- Session log repair tool (`scripts/repair-log.mjs`) for the upstream interruption-flush seq-reorder bug.
